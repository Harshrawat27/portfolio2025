    content: `I don't believe in luck, but I do believe in serendipity. This is just a letter to my 10-years-later version.

I started my side project journey 5 months ago (I know words like startup and indie hacking sound too heavy, so I won't use them). So far, I've launched 3 products. The first one got zero traction. The second one got some. The third one? Decent traction—and I'm grinding on more.

Before this, I used to freelance as a web developer. But I actually started out as a book designer.

Back in 2021, I began designing books. Around that time, I was constantly searching about small businesses, so maybe that's why YouTube recommended me a video on KDP. Not sure how much individual sellers are making these days, but back then, KDP was trending. I learned how to design KDP books in just 2 hours and created my gigs on 2–3 major freelancing platforms.

Originally, my plan was to sell books. But if I remember correctly, back then you couldn't sell directly on KDP from India. That's why I ended up offering design services instead.

When I was creating my gig, I had zero expectations. I had never seen anyone around me succeed in freelancing. But I still took the leap.

Around 12 days later, I got my first message. And somehow, that message turned into my first client. Competition in KDP book design was really low at that time. I still remember—on some keywords, I was ranking on the first page.

That first order was for $30, and the client even gave me a $15 tip. $45. My first online income. I was so happy. It felt like magic. A person in New Zealand giving work to someone in India.

My first year (2021) didn't bring much income. I could've earned more from a random job. But in the second year, I continued as a book designer and 10x'd my previous year's earnings. It felt like success, and it was—but even then, the total amount wasn't that huge.

Many close friends and family members asked, "Why are you doing this? You could've earned the same doing any job." But I shut out the noise.

I kept going till mid-2022. Eventually, I realized even the top sellers weren't earning that much. I also got tired of the work—it became too monotonous, too boring.

That's when I stumbled upon web development. Now, web dev on freelancing platforms is tough. Super competitive. But thankfully, my 25+ reviews from book design gave me a head start. To clients, I didn't look like someone new—I looked experienced. Who would've thought that designing books would help me in that way?

In 2023, I 13x'd my revenue. That year felt good.

In 2024, I grew another 1.6x. I could've taken it to 2.5x easily, but toward the end of the year, I shifted my focus toward learning and building side projects—so I took on fewer freelance gigs.

That's why I don't believe in luck, but I do believe in serendipity. One random YouTube video. A 2-hour learning session. Creating a gig. Low competition. First few reviews. And then turning that momentum into web development work. None of this was planned. It just happened.

A few years from now, I'll probably look back at my side project journey and write another letter like this.

Till then—

Keep building. Keep pushing. Things will fall into place.`,

    excerpt:
      'Sometimes those initial $ can create silly biases in you. A raw reflection on staying true to your craft and not getting distracted by quick money in freelancing.',
    content: `Just talked to someone about creating a video. I had hired him as a video editor 1–2 years ago.

Now, he has shifted to UI/UX design, social media post design, and all that.

Honestly, I felt bad after hearing this.

Don't fall for money. Sometimes those initial $ can create silly biases in you.

As a freelancer, it's easy to get distracted from your original craft. You position yourself as a video editor, but someone approaches you for social media post designs, and you start doing that instead.

This especially happens with Indian freelancers. Everyone in the world knows you'll work for them at very cheap rates.

There's nothing wrong with taking that work but at least have the guts to pass it to someone else and make 20–30% commission only.

Don't start doing anything that has no future just for a little money.

Now I'm going to say something harsh—sorry if you feel bad after listening to this. No one, absolutely no one, truly enjoys designing random social media posts or just doing basic UI/UX forever.

If you are truly a designer at heart, if you breathe design day and night, then someday, you'll move towards designing real, physical products.

Designing rockets is any day more exciting than designing Instagram posts.

Don't fall into the trap. Keep pushing yourself. You're capable of much more.`,
