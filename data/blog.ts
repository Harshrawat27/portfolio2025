    title: 'A Letter to My 10-Years-Later Version',
    excerpt:
      "I don't believe in luck, but I do believe in serendipity. This is just a letter to my 10-years-later version. A journey from book design to web development to building side projects.",
    content: `I don't believe in luck, but I do believe in serendipity. This is just a letter to my 10-years-later version.

I started my side project journey 5 months ago (I know words like startup and indie hacking sound too heavy, so I won't use them). So far, I've launched 3 products. The first one got zero traction. The second one got some. The third one? Decent traction—and I'm grinding on more.

Before this, I used to freelance as a web developer. But I actually started out as a book designer.

Back in 2021, I began designing books. Around that time, I was constantly searching about small businesses, so maybe that's why YouTube recommended me a video on KDP. Not sure how much individual sellers are making these days, but back then, KDP was trending. I learned how to design KDP books in just 2 hours and created my gigs on 2–3 major freelancing platforms.

Originally, my plan was to sell books. But if I remember correctly, back then you couldn't sell directly on KDP from India. That's why I ended up offering design services instead.

When I was creating my gig, I had zero expectations. I had never seen anyone around me succeed in freelancing. But I still took the leap.

Around 12 days later, I got my first message. And somehow, that message turned into my first client. Competition in KDP book design was really low at that time. I still remember—on some keywords, I was ranking on the first page.

That first order was for $30, and the client even gave me a $15 tip. $45. My first online income. I was so happy. It felt like magic. A person in New Zealand giving work to someone in India.

My first year (2021) didn't bring much income. I could've earned more from a random job. But in the second year, I continued as a book designer and 10x'd my previous year's earnings. It felt like success, and it was—but even then, the total amount wasn't that huge.

Many close friends and family members asked, "Why are you doing this? You could've earned the same doing any job." But I shut out the noise.

I kept going till mid-2022. Eventually, I realized even the top sellers weren't earning that much. I also got tired of the work—it became too monotonous, too boring.

That's when I stumbled upon web development. Now, web dev on freelancing platforms is tough. Super competitive. But thankfully, my 25+ reviews from book design gave me a head start. To clients, I didn't look like someone new—I looked experienced. Who would've thought that designing books would help me in that way?

In 2023, I 13x'd my revenue. That year felt good.

In 2024, I grew another 1.6x. I could've taken it to 2.5x easily, but toward the end of the year, I shifted my focus toward learning and building side projects—so I took on fewer freelance gigs.

That's why I don't believe in luck, but I do believe in serendipity. One random YouTube video. A 2-hour learning session. Creating a gig. Low competition. First few reviews. And then turning that momentum into web development work. None of this was planned. It just happened.

A few years from now, I'll probably look back at my side project journey and write another letter like this.

Till then—

Keep building. Keep pushing. Things will fall into place.`,

    title: 'Why we should never game the system.',
    excerpt:
      'should we do whatever it takes to succeed in our 20s, or should we make some hard calls?',
    content: `This article is more for me than anyone else. It's mainly about how I'm planning to live my 20s or more specifically, my life. These days, I see so many people gaming the system. But the real question is: should we do whatever it takes to succeed in our 20s, or should we make some hard calls?

    There are so many people who are just “YES sir” kind of people. They'll always say yes to things, situations, or people they think can make them successful. But what they don't ask is *is life only about success?'
    
    Yes, gaming the system can sometimes give you promotions, chances to climb the ladder, and even boost your ranking on the leaderboard. But over time, it destroys your self-esteem.
    
    I don't want my kids, my parents, my partner, and most of all myself to see me as a person without self-esteem.
    
    (Okay, let's not make this dramatic.)
    
    Sometimes we take ourselves too seriously both success and failure. In fact, so many people who only know 10% of my ambition say to me: *“Sometimes your ambition feels too big. What will you do if you fail to achieve it?”* Honestly, I just laugh.
    
    We say “kid brain” for kids and “adult brain” for adults, but I believe 99.99% of people live life like kids. Think about it if kids are building castles on the riverbank and a wave comes to destroy them, the kids cry. But you, as an adult, will laugh. Why? Because you know three things: first, it was just a game. Second, it wasn't a real castle. Third, the kid started with nothing and now has nothing again. Even if the wave didn't destroy the castle, sooner or later they'd have to leave it behind when going home.
    
    We understand this truth in small things, but we rarely apply it to life. Life is the same we started with nothing, and we'll leave with nothing. Along the way, we build some castles. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we fail, sometimes circumstances wipe them out. And even if we somehow manage to preserve our castles, in the end, we'll still have to leave them behind.
    
    Now, you might ask: if the destiny of every castle is to be destroyed, then why build them in the first place? The answer is simple: even when you know it's just a game, you still have to play. Otherwise, what will you do? How long can you just sit on the riverbank, refusing to play, simply because you know it's only a game?
    
    That's why, until my last breath, I'll play all the games. I'll give my 100%. I'll fight for everything that belongs to me. But deep down, I'll always know it's just a game where the player won't be around to see the final scorecard.
    
    On my deathbed, I want wisdom more than anything. And self-esteem is the foundation to achieve that wisdom. That's why I'll never try to game the system.`,

      'Sometimes those initial $ can create silly biases in you. A raw reflection on staying true to your craft and not getting distracted by quick money in freelancing.',
    content: `Just talked to someone about creating a video. I had hired him as a video editor 1–2 years ago.

Now, he has shifted to UI/UX design, social media post design, and all that.

Honestly, I felt bad after hearing this.

Don't fall for money. Sometimes those initial $ can create silly biases in you.

As a freelancer, it's easy to get distracted from your original craft. You position yourself as a video editor, but someone approaches you for social media post designs, and you start doing that instead.

This especially happens with Indian freelancers. Everyone in the world knows you'll work for them at very cheap rates.

There's nothing wrong with taking that work but at least have the guts to pass it to someone else and make 20–30% commission only.

Don't start doing anything that has no future just for a little money.

Now I'm going to say something harsh—sorry if you feel bad after listening to this. No one, absolutely no one, truly enjoys designing random social media posts or just doing basic UI/UX forever.

If you are truly a designer at heart, if you breathe design day and night, then someday, you'll move towards designing real, physical products.

Designing rockets is any day more exciting than designing Instagram posts.

Don't fall into the trap. Keep pushing yourself. You're capable of much more.`,

      'Why starting with action often leads to deeper understanding than theoretical learning alone. A reflection on the power of learning through doing.',
    content: `We are often better at *doing* things than fully *understanding* them.
  
  When it comes to doing things, many people think we first have to understand something completely and then start doing it. But I believe it's often more effective to take another approach: first, start doing things, and then understand them along the way.
  
  It might sound counterintuitive, right?
  
  It's easier to write imperfect code first and then understand every bit of it and how to improve it later. If you get stuck in a loop, waiting to write your first line of code until you fully understand everything, you might never start. In fact, even if you start with trying to understand everything upfront, you'll likely still have many doubts because it's hard to measure theoretical understanding without practical application.
  
  This thought really crystallized for me when I reflected on my own first project. I learned the basics of web development in about 10-12 days, and within the next 10-12 days, I landed my [first web development project](/blogs/a-letter-to-myself). It was my good fortune that this website was quite complex, especially in terms of animations and other features. But I said yes to the challenge. Honestly, at that point, I probably only knew about 40% of what was required; the other 60% was uncharted territory for me. I broke the website multiple times in the process, found and experimented with at least 10 different libraries, figured out how to integrate external libraries into the project, and ultimately completed it in 20s days.
  
  I'm absolutely sure no book or course could have taught me that much in just 15 days. And now, because of that hands-on experience, it's much easier for me to understand the logic behind how things work in web development.
  
  Evolutionary-wise, this rings true as well. Much of human progress has been built on empirical observation and iteration. We tried something; if it worked, we kept it or improved it; if it didn't, we adjusted. This bias towards action and learning from direct experience would have offered significant survival and adaptive advantages, allowing us to navigate and shape our environments effectively. Think of the discovery of fire, the development of early agriculture, or even the origins of medicine.
  
  The 'doing' often preceded the deep 'why'.`,

      'From Zero to Top 1%: My Freelancing Journey and How You Can Start Yours',
    excerpt:
      "I went from starting freelancing in 2021 to becoming a top 1% freelancer in India by 2023. Here's my complete step-by-step guide to help you start your own successful freelancing journey.",

# From Zero to Top 1%: My Freelancing Journey and How You Can Start Yours

I started my freelancing journey in 2021, and by the end of 2023, I was among the top 1% of freelancers in India. Freelancing has given me the freedom to experiment and grow on my own terms.

Let me break down how you can start your freelancing journey, step by step.

## 1. Create Your Portfolio

If you're a web developer, your first priority should be creating your portfolio. It's much easier to find your first clients through your own contacts than online.

**Key Steps:**
- Reach out to everyone you know and build websites for them
- Accept whatever budget they have initially
- Focus on getting 2–3 real projects under your belt
- Avoid subdomain websites - people don't trust them

> **Pro Tip:** People don't trust subdomain websites; you'll need 2–3 real projects under your belt before you can land bigger ones.

## 2. Find Your First Customers

Register yourself on 2–3 major freelancing platforms. Yes, there's a lot of competition, but who cares? Your goal is simply to increase your surface area of luck and land those first few clients.

**Popular Platforms:**
- Upwork
- Fiverr  
- Freelancer
- Toptal (for advanced developers)

## 3. Optimize Your Profile

Take care of these essential elements:

### Profile Basics:
- **Get a decent headshot profile picture** - Professional appearance matters
- **Study the top 10 profiles** in your domain and write your title and description accordingly
- **Target keywords with low competition** and low to medium traffic initially

### Why Target Low-Medium Traffic?
Because there's no such thing as high traffic with low competition. In the beginning, you need to become a **big fish in a small pond**, not a small fish in a big one. Position yourself as the most professional freelancer among just 10 profiles, not thousands.

## 4. Keyword Research Strategy

Keyword research on these platforms isn't that hard:

**Steps:**
1. Type a keyword and see how many profiles show up
2. Search at least 10–15 keywords
3. Build your profile around the ones with:
   - Least competition
   - Low to medium traffic
4. Don't get greedy in the beginning

## 5. Craft Your Description and Title

**Research Process:**
- Filter out 10 mid-level profiles
- Study their titles and descriptions
- Don't just copy/paste - "stealing the right way is a skill"
- Take the best parts from each
- Keep your profile focused on 1–2 services, not everything

**Key Rule:** Your main pitch should stick to just 1–2 services, not everything.

## 6. Leverage Other Channels

### Social Media Strategy:
- **Twitter:** Stay active and engage with potential clients
- **Discord:** One of the best places to find potential clients
- **Instagram:** Reach out directly to businesses that need your services
  - Example: If someone is posting reels about cakes but doesn't have a website, send them a message

## My Personal Story

Honestly, finding your first customer isn't that hard. If you follow all the above points and ask for humble rates initially, you'll definitely get a client in the first 20-30 days.

### The Competition Myth

Many people think there's so much competition in freelancing, but that's not true from one perspective. I realized this when I started hiring freelancers to delegate projects.

**The Reality:**
- Most people really don't care about quality
- You'll have to chase them with dozens of messages for updates
- They rarely meet deadlines
- Poor communication is the norm

## The Success Formula: Under-Promise and Over-Deliver

This is the essence of retaining customers:

### Key Practices:
- **Deliver before time** - Always beat your deadlines
- **Reply on time** - I replied to 90%+ of queries within an hour throughout my freelancing journey
- **Do extra work** - Don't just add hourly rate for 1-2 hour tasks
- **Build relationships** - Focus on long-term client retention

### The Numbers That Matter:
In 2024, **50% of my revenue was from old clients**. This shows the power of relationship building.

## Scaling Your Rates

If you can consistently deliver good work and build strong relationships, people won't hesitate to pay you.

**Rate Increase Strategy:**
- **Existing clients:** Increase rates every 5–6 months
- **New clients:** Once you have 10–15 projects, raise prices with every new project
- **Market dynamics:** It's simple demand and supply

## The Power of Transparency

Transparency is the key to maintaining good relationships. 

**Think about it:** You don't get frustrated with an Amazon order because it's late - you get frustrated because you were expecting it early.

**Best Practices:**
- If facing delays, be transparent
- Keep people updated about everything
- Set realistic expectations from the start

## Timeline and Expectations

**Reality Check:**
- You won't start making money from day one
- It usually takes at least **8–9 months** to reach a decent level
- But you **will start making some money from the 1st month** if you follow the above steps

**Patience is Key:** Don't expect overnight success, but consistent effort will pay off.

## Final Advice

**Skip the Expensive Courses:** Don't waste your money on courses by every random instructor. They'll teach you the same stuff - there's no secret sauce.

**The Real Secret:** Consistency, professionalism, and genuine care for your clients' success.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with your network** - easier than cold outreach
2. **Be a big fish in a small pond** - target low competition keywords
3. **Under-promise and over-deliver** - this builds lasting relationships
4. **Transparency is everything** - keep clients informed
5. **Focus on retention** - old clients are your best source of revenue
6. **Be patient** - success takes 8-9 months but starts in month 1

Remember, freelancing isn't just about finding clients - it's about building a sustainable business based on trust, quality, and consistent delivery. Focus on these fundamentals, and you'll be well on your way to joining the top tier of freelancers.

Good luck with your freelancing journey! 🚀

  # After working as a freelancer for 3 years. here's what i've learned about the pricing freelance projects
  
  there are mainly 5 types of pricing:
  - hourly
  - fixed/project based pricing
  - retainer pricing
  - value based pricing
  - daily pricing
  
  every pricing model has its pros and cons you can't use the same one for every project.
  
  ## Hourly Pricing
  
  this is good if you are just starting your freelancing career and client insists on hourly billing. it's one of those models mostly used by beginners and highly experienced freelancers beginners often have to accept this while experienced ones charge a premium.
  
  imo stay away for it if you can. i do know one person who charges $200/hour and work like 8-10 hours per day.
  - slow down learning
  - send weekly invoices
  - maintain hourly sheet
  
  ## Fixed/Project Based Pricing
  
  this is the pricing i've worked with the most and i love it. it's best if you are on intermediate level.
  - gives you freedom to explore more
  - not answerable on a daily basis
  - charge 50% upfront get work done and collect the remaining amount
  
  if you've mastered your craft and built a strong library of reusable components, this model can effectively pay you $300/hour. there were times when i reused code from past projects and charged $300 for work that took me just an hour.
  
  ## Retainer Pricing
  
  - the client pays a set monthly (or periodic) fee to reserve your time or services
  - it's like monthly drug (salary) in our field we mostly charge this one the work is done
  
  I used to charge $300/month for 7–8 hours of work mostly ongoing changes and small fixes. if you land 3 such clients that's around $900/month for just 25 hours of work. TCS and Infosys monthly salary in 25 hours.
  
  ## Value Based Pricing
  
  - you charge for value or impact of the work to the client
  - risky model but it's the only one with the potential to make you a millionaire $ freelancer
  - if you can increase sales of business by X then charge 10% of the X. sell $10M worth of good and become a millionaire
  
  ## Daily Pricing
  
  sometimes 1 day = 8 hours or if you have skill issues 1 day = 1 day in my words this is what I call the labour pricing model. if you're stuck working this way it's a skill issue level up your skills.
